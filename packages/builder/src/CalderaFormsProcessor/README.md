# Caldera Forms Processor

This exists so we can use the shiny new processor UI in Caldera Forms' form editor for new add-ons/ add-on updates. This is designed to act as a standalone processor for use in Caldera Forms 1.x form editor when @calderajs/builder does NOT manage the complete processor UI system.
